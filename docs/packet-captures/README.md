# Packet Captures

These are packet captures with some annotation from a real RS422 to RS232 Derby Owners Club board labeled 'RS422/RS232C BD DOC'.

The two files 'from-naomi' and 'to-naomi' where captured seperately as I didn't have the correct equiptment to capture at the same time. This means you must use some intuition to work out what is a request and what is a response.
